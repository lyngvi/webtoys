Some fun projects for web development...

First, we need an oscilloscope (HTML5 canvas rendering with a bit of brains.)

Start with a graph, which can:
	1) Render to arbitrary canvas
	2) Automatic, labeled grid axes with human-legible units
	3) Expects to receive data possibly in a TypedBuffer
	4) May be able to optimize shifting data out and new data in
	5) Show up to N adjustable labels on the X and Y axes and have events
       on when the user tries to drag them? For trigger control primarily.

Add control/filter functionality with the ability to synchronize to some characteristic of the input signal
(that is, trigger capability, possibly after a filter of some kind?) and shift X axis by some configurable
trigger value.

Second, we want some audio processing. Need to be able to generate a signal and interpret it as audio;
also need to be able to play audio from a file (HTML5 media element + input type="file"?)

	- Web Audio API: ScriptProcessorNode event "onaudioprocess". Looks trivially easy to use. Woohoo!
      But is this real-time only or can the audio be "played back" at top speed.

This may need to be asm.js optimized - is this possible? Should think so...

It'd be nice if after all that, you could do some wacky shit like have the background change colors in rhythm with the music.
Might be achievable by triggering on RMS or some other silly thing.

From there we can start doing some frequency shifting, FFTs, and other such nonsense. Should be entertaining.
